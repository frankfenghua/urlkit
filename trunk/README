This software is provided under the open source license agreement
attached at the end of this file.

USAGE

1. Add the library bin/UrlKit.swc into your ActionScript
classpath.  The MXML components associated with UrlKit are all available
at the following component manifest URL:

    http://www.allurent.com/2006/urlkit


2. Add UrlKit components to your project as needed.


3. Modify your application's HTML source code as follows:

  a. ensure that the standard Flex "history" IFRAME is not included.

  b. either use the exact scripting approach shown in html-template/index.template.html
     or include all material comments marked "REQUIRED UrlKit SECTION".
     
  c. if not using the index.template.html approach to generating your OBJECT/EMBED
     markup, then be sure you're not nesting an EMBED tag inside an OBJECT tag in
     your system as this breaks Safari bookmarking support.
     

4. Add the following files from the html-template/ directory to the same directory
containing the page that loads your Flex application:

	historyFrame.html
	urlkit.css
	urlkit.js


DOCUMENTATION

Please see the files UrlKit.htm (HTML) or UrlKit.doc (MS Word).  Beyond that,
the source code comments provide a more detailed guide to the full
functionality of the package.


BROWSER SUPPORT

	Firefox 1.5

COMPILATION FROM SOURCE

Two options are provided:

1. You may import the distribution as a complete Flex Builder 2
project definition and build it there.
