Prepared 0.51 release of UrlKit based on bug fixes stemming from
unit test suite completion in separate UrlKitTest project.

Fixes:
        - default pattern for UrlValueRule changed from .* to (.*), so
          that an out-of-the-box value rule works properly.

        - fixed subtle initialization-order issue for UrlNavigatorRule
          in which a pending browser change was dropped on the floor
          if the control wasn't initialized yet.

        - UrlRuleContainer.addChild() was not setting the parent rule
          into the child.

        - UrlRuleSets that bailed due to lack of satisfaction on ALL
          or ONE constraint were still exhibiting a non-empty URL.

        - needless CHANGE events were being generated by changes
          to rule string values that set the same value back into the
          rule.

        - the sourceValue property caused a runtime exception when given a
          dot-delimited property chain "a.b" and the value of a was temporarily
          null.
