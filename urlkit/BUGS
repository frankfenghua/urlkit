- Safari history support: navigating w/ back and forward across
boundary of set of URLs belonging to UrlKit app causes bookkeeping problems.

- IE6: loading bookmarks (Allan Young <allany@adobe.com>)

- IE6: titles of history entries
> Also (unrelated) the history popup menu in IE shows a truncated full

> Firefox shows just the browser window title for my pushed pages.
